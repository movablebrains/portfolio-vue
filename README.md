# Portfolio Vue

## Introduction

This is the VueJS version of the previous design of my [personal website](https://webdevsuperfast.netlify.com/) which is based on Jekyll and Stream UI. It pulls data from [Heroku](https://heroku.com) using a fake REST API built using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Building from Source

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.org).
5. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies through terminal/CLI program.
6. Run `yarn run serve` through your favorite CLI program.

 **Note:** I suggest using package manager to install Git, Node and Yarn. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you're on a Mac or Linux/WSL, [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) if you're on Windows.
